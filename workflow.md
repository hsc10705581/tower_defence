- rel_[name]: release branch.

## start a feature
This will create new feature branch and push it to remote.
    
    git flow feature start [name]
    git flow feature publish [name]

example:

    git flow feature start test
    git flow feature publish test

## start your contribution
First checkout your working branch:

    git checkout -b [your_github_name] [based_on_branch]
    
When finished, but not complete the whole work:

    // git add/commit or some operation to your branch.
    git push -u origin [your_github_name]

When finished the whole work, go github and submit a PR to [based_on_branch] with [your_github_name]. After being merged, your branch will be deleted.
You can use

    git pull -p

or

    git branch -d [your_github_name]

to tidy up your local workspace.
